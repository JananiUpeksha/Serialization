# Serialization & Deserialization
An object has three primary characteristics: identity, state, and behavior. The state represents the value or data of the object.
Serialization is the process of converting an object’s state to a byte stream. This byte stream can then be saved to a file, sent over a network, or stored in a database. The byte stream represents the object’s state, which can later be reconstructed to create a new copy of the object.Serialization allows us to save the data associated with an object and recreate the object in a new location.
Many different formats can be used for serialization, such as JSON, XML, and binary. JSON and XML are popular formats for serialization because they are human-readable and can be easily parsed by other systems. Binary formats are often used for performance reasons, as they’re typically faster to read and write than text-based formats.

Deserialization is the reverse process of serialization. It involves taking a byte stream and converting it back into an object. This is done using the appropriate tools to parse the byte stream and create a new object. In Java, the ObjectInputStream class can be used to deserialize a binary format, and the Jackson library can be used to parse a JSON format.


Benefits of Serialization & Deserialization
The benefits of serialization extend beyond its basic function. Key advantages include:
1.Data Interchange: Serialized data allows for seamless communication between different software system components.
2.Storage Efficiency: Serialization optimizes data storage, making it compact and easily manageable.
3.Versioning and Compatibility: Serialized data can be versioned, enhancing compatibility between different software versions.


Deserialization offers several advantages, enhancing the functionality of software systems:
1.Data Restoration: Deserialization allows data restoration to its original, complex structure, ensuring its meaningful use.
2.Efficient Data Processing: It enables efficient processing of serialized data, promoting streamlined functionality within applications.
3.Integration with External Systems: Deserialization is essential for seamlessly integrating data from external sources into a software system.

The Employee class acts as a fundamental data structure that encapsulates information about an employee, including attributes such as id, name, address, and age. This class plays a pivotal role in the serialization and deserialization mechanisms implemented. 

During serialization, an instance of Employee is instantiated with specific attribute values. The `ObjectOutputStream` is then used to serialize this object, converting its state into a byte stream that represents the object's data. This serialized data is written to a file (`employee.ser`) using a `FileOutputStream`, facilitating storage or transmission of the object's state across different executions or systems.

during deserialization, the `employee.ser` file is read using a `FileInputStream`, and an `ObjectInputStream` is employed to reconstruct the serialized byte stream back into an `Employee` object. The `readObject()` method of `ObjectInputStream` deserializes the byte stream, restoring the object's state to its original form. This process enables the retrieval and restoration of previously serialized data, allowing applications to resume or transfer the stored object's state seamlessly.

By implementing the `Serializable` interface, the `Employee` class indicates its support for serialization and deserialization, making it capable of efficiently storing and retrieving its instances as byte streams. This capability is essential for data persistence, inter-process communication, and maintaining object state across different runtime environments in Java applications. Thus, the `Employee` class serves as a foundational component enabling effective data management and object communication within the application's lifecycle.
